	abstract = {Diapycnal mixing plays a primary role in the thermodynamic balance of the ocean and, consequently, in oceanic heat and carbon uptake and storage. Though observed mixing rates are on average consistent with values required by inverse models, recent attention has focused on the dramatic spatial variability, spanning several orders of magnitude, of mixing rates in both the upper and deep ocean. Away from ocean boundaries, the spatiotemporal patterns of mixing are largely driven by the geography of generation, propagation, and dissipation of internal waves, which supply much of the power for turbulent mixing. Over the last 5 years and under the auspices of U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR), a National Science Foundation (NSF)- and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-supported Climate Process Team has been engaged in developing, implementing, and testing dynamics-based parameterizations for internal wave–driven turbulent mixing in global ocean models. The work has primarily focused on turbulence 1) near sites of internal tide generation, 2) in the upper ocean related to wind-generated near inertial motions, 3) due to internal lee waves generated by low-frequency mesoscale flows over topography, and 4) at ocean margins. Here, we review recent progress, describe the tools developed, and discuss future directions.},

Using the ozone concentration measurements, we classify the results as tropospheric or stratospheric. We further divide the results into four absolute latitude bands. For separation distance r between 10 and 100 km, the lower stratospheric diagonal third-order structure functions are proportional to negative r. This implies a downscale energy cascade, and we estimate the mean energy dissipation rate to be 〈ε〉 ≈ 6 × 10−5 m2 s−3. For r between 300 and 1500 km, a positive r3 dependence was visible for the polar stratospheric data. This may be the result of a two-dimensional (2D) turbulence downscale enstrophy cascade, and we estimate the average enstrophy flux to be Πω ≈ 2 × 10−15 s−3 and the energy spectral constant to be κ ≈ 2. The negative sign of these third-order functions at mesoscales in both the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere provide no support for an inverse energy cascade 2D turbulence. At scales above ∼100 km, the second-order structure functions increase with latitude in the troposphere and decrease with latitude in the stratosphere. The off-diagonal third-order functions in the stratosphere show a remarkably clean negative r2 dependency from 10 to 1000 km in scale.},

	abstract = {We have contrived a model E(αω) α μ−1ω−p+1(ω 2−ω i 2)−+ for the distribution of internal wave energy in horizontal wavenumber, frequency-space, with wavenumber α extending to some upper limit μ(ω) α ω r-1 (ω 2−ω i 2)½, and frequency ω extending from the inertial frequency ω i to the local Väisälä frequency n(y). The spectrum is portrayed as an equivalent continuum to which the modal structure (if it exists) is not vital. We assume horizontal isotropy, E(α, ω) = 2παE(α1, α2, ω), with α1, α2 designating components of α. Certain moments of E(α1, α2, ω) can be derived from observations. (i) Moored (or freely floating) devices measuring horizontal current u(t), vertical displacement η(t),…, yield the frequency spectra F (u,η,…)(ω) = ∫∫ (U 2, Z 2,…)E(α1, ∞2, ω) dα1 dα2, where U, Z,… are the appropriate wave functions. (ii) Similarly towed measurements give the wavenumber spectrum F (…)(α1) = ∫∫… dα2 dω. (iii) Moored measurements horizontally separated by X yield the coherence spectrum R(X, ω) which is related to the horizontal cosine transform ∫∫ E(α1, α2 ω) cos α1 Xdα1 dα1. (iv) Moored measurements vertically separated by Y yield R(Y, ω) and (v) towed measurements vertically separated yield R(Y, α1), and these are related to similar vertical Fourier transforms. Away from inertial frequencies, our model E(α, ω) α ω −p-r for α ≦ μ ω ω r, yields F(ω) ∞ ω −p, F(α1) ∞ α1 −q, with q = (p + r − 1)/r. The observed moored and towed spectra suggest p and q between 5/3 and 2, yielding r between 2/3 and 3/2, inconsistent with a value of r = 2 derived from Webster's measurements of moored vertical coherence. We ascribe Webster's result to the oceanic fine-structure. Our choice (p, q, r) = (2, 2, 1) is then not inconsistent with existing evidence. The spectrum is E(∞, ω) ∞ ω −1(ω 2−ω i 2 −1, and the α-bandwith μ ∞ (ω 2−ω i 2)+ is equivalent to about 20 modes. Finally, we consider the frequency-of-encounter spectra F([sgrave]) at any towing speed S, approaching F(ω) as S ≦ S o, and F(α1) for α1 = [sgrave]/S as S ≧ S o, where S o = 0(1 km/h) is the relevant Doppler velocity scale.},

	abstract = {A near-global chart of surface elevations associated with the stationary M2 internal tide is empirically constructed from multimission satellite altimeter data. An advantage of a strictly empirical mapping approach is that results are independent of assumptions about ocean wave dynamics and, in fact, can be used to test such assumptions. A disadvantage is that present-day altimeter coverage is only marginally adequate to support mapping such short-wavelength features. Moreover, predominantly north–south ground-track orientations and contamination from nontidal oceanographic variability can lead to deficiencies in mapped tides. Independent data from Cryosphere Satellite-2 (CryoSat-2) and other altimeters are used to test the solutions and show positive reduction in variance except in regions of large mesoscale variability. The tidal fields are subjected to two-dimensional wavenumber spectral analysis, which allows for the construction of an empirical map of modal wavelengths. Mode-1 wavelengths show good agreement with theoretical wavelengths calculated from the ocean’s mean stratification, with a few localized exceptions (e.g., Tasman Sea). Mode-2 waves are detectable in much of the ocean, with wavelengths in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations, but their spectral signatures grow too weak to map in some regions.},

The second order velocity structure function and its decomposition into rotational and divergent components are examined. The results reveal that the divergent component, compared to the rotational component, dominates at scales below 5 km, and the pattern is reversed at larger scales. The divergent component has a slope near 2/3 below 5 km, similar to an energy cascade range (k − 5/3). The third order velocity structure function at scales below 5km is negative and implies a forward cascade of energy to smaller scales. The rotational component has a steeper slope, roughly 1.5, from scales of 5km up to the deformation radius. This is similar to a 2D enstrophy cascade, although the slope is shallower than the predicted 2. There is a brief 2/3 range from the deformation radius to 200 km, suggestive of a 2D inverse cascade.},

	abstract = {Tidal flow through the Luzon Strait produces large internal waves that propagate westward into the South China Sea and eastward into the Pacific. Underwater gliders gathered sustained observations of internal waves during seven overlapping missions from April 2007 through July 2008. A particular focus is the high-frequency internal waves, where the operational definition of high involves periods shorter than a glider profile taking 3–6 h. Internal wave vertical velocity is estimated from measurements of pressure and glider orientation through two methods: (1) use of a model of glider flight balancing buoyancy and drag along the glider path and (2) high-pass filtering of the observed glider vertical velocity. By combining high-frequency vertical velocities from glider flight with low-frequency estimates from isopycnal depth variations between dives, a spectrum covering five decades of frequency is constructed. A map of the standard deviation of vertical velocity over the survey area shows a decay from the Luzon Strait into the Pacific. The growth of high-frequency vertical velocity with propagation into the South China Sea is observed through two 2-week time series stations. The largest observed vertical velocities are greater than 0.2 m s−1 and are associated with displacements approaching 200 m. The high-frequency waves are observed at regular intervals of 1 day as they ride on diurnal tidal internal waves generated in the Strait.},

These mesoscale eddy signals have a well-defined annual cycle with a maximum in December/January and a minimum in May/June. As the southeasterly trades intercept the island mountains of Vanuatu and Fiji, they generate localized wind stress curl dipoles, which in turn induce the eastward-flowing Coral Sea Countercurrent (CSCC) and Fiji Basin Countercurrent (FBCC) in the Coral Sea and the North Fiji Basin, respectively. The high eddy variability band along 16°S is hypothesized in this study as resulting from barotropic instability due to the lateral shear between the eastward-flowing CSCC and its neighboring westward-flowing North Caledonian and North Vanuatu jets (NCJ and NVJ). Based on stability analyses on the background NCJ–CSCC–NVJ system, it is found that the most unstable mode of the system has an equivalent barotropic structure and is insensitive to the specification of the background flow’s vertical shear. This barotropic instability hypothesis is also supported by observations; specifically, the Reynolds stresses inferred from the observed SSH data are tilted against the meridional shear of the background NCJ–CSCC–NVJ flow. As the intensity of the NCJ–CSCC–NVJ shear fluctuates with the season, the growth rate of instability changes, resulting in seasonal amplitude modulations in the observed 70-day eddy signals.},

Chapters 1 examines the relationship between the molecular and continuum models of the fluid, and between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of the latter. Ch.2 is a broad introduction to the fluid dynamics of rotating, stratified flows. Ch.3 adddresses large-scale ocean circulation. Chs.4,5 and 6 discuss the theory of turbulence, including elementary ideas based on vorticity laws (Ch.4), statistical turbulence theory (Ch.5), and the applications of these ideas to quasigeostrophic flows in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere (Ch.6). Ch.7 surveys Hamiltonoian fluid dynamics, including the interaction between waves and currents, and "balanced" approximations to nearly geostrophic flow. Overall, the emphasis is on physical ideas rather than mathematical techniques. Readers are assumed to have had an elementary introduction to fluid mechanics, to know advanced calculus through partial differential equations, and to be familiar with the elementary ideas about linear waves, including the concept of group velocity.},

In the Gulf Stream region, steep kinetic energy spectra at scales between 200 and 20 km are consistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic–turbulence theory, both in the mixed layer and in the thermocline. At scales below 20 km, the spectra flatten out, consistent with a growing contribution of internal-wave energy at small scales. In the subtropical North Pacific, the energy spectra are flatter and inconsistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic–turbulence theory. The observed spectra and their dependence on depth are also inconsistent with predictions of surface quasigeostrophic–turbulence theory for the observed ocean stratification. It appears that unbalanced motions, most likely internal tides at large scales and the internal-wave continuum at small scales, dominate the energy spectrum throughout the submesoscale range. Spectra of temperature variance along density surfaces, which are not affected by internal tides, are also inconsistent with predictions of geostrophic-turbulence theories. Reasons for this inconsistency could be the injection of energy in the submesoscale range by small-scale baroclinic instabilities or modifications of the spectra by coupling between surface and interior dynamics or by ageostrophic frontal effects.},

	abstract = {Conventional radar altimeter makes measurement of sea surface height (SSH) in one-dimensional profiles along the ground tracks of a satellite. Such profiles are combined via various mapping techniques to construct two-dimensional SSH maps, providing a valuable data record over the past two decades for studying the global ocean circulation and sea level change. However, the spatial resolution of the SSH is limited by both coarse sampling across the satellite tracks and the instrument error in the profile measurements. A new satellite mission based on radar interferometry offers the capability of making high-resolution wide-swath measurement of SSH. This mission is called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), which will demonstrate the application of swath altimeter to both oceanography and land hydrology. This paper presents a brief introduction to the design of SWOT, its performance specification for SSH, and the anticipated spatial resolution and coverage, demonstrating the promise of SWOT for fundamental advancement in observing SSH. A main objective of the paper is to address issues in the anticipated transition of conventional profile altimetry to swath altimetry in the future—in particular, the need for consistency of the new observing system with the old for extending the existing data record into the future. A viable approach is to carry a profile altimeter in the SWOT payload to provide calibration and validation of the new measurement against the old at large scales. This is the baseline design of SWOT. The unique advantages of the approach are discussed in the context of a new standard for observing the global SSH in the future.},

	abstract = {In the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude western boundary current (WBC) systems there is a complex interaction between dynamics and thermodynamics and between atmosphere and ocean. Their potential contribution to the climate system motivated major parallel field programs in both the North Pacific [Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS)] and the North Atlantic [Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE)], and preliminary observations and analyses from these programs highlight that complexity. The Gulf Stream (GS) in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Extension (KE) in the North Pacific have broad similarities, as subtropical gyre WBCs, but they also have significant differences, which affect the regional air–sea exchange processes and their larger-scale interactions. The 15-yr satellite altimeter data record, which provides a rich source of information, is combined here with the longer historical record from in situ data to describe and compare the current systems. While many important similarities have been noted on the dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of the time-varying GS and KE, some not-so-subtle differences exist in current variability, mode water properties, and recirculation gyre structure. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of these two current systems from both dynamical and thermodynamical perspectives with the goal of developing and evaluating hypotheses about the physics underlying the observed differences, and exploring the WBC’s potential to influence midlatitude sea–air interaction. Differences between the GS and KE systems offer opportunities to compare the dominant processes and thereby to advance understanding of their role in the climate system.},

It then analyzes the patterns in the suite to select a final MLD estimate. The new algorithm is provided in online supplemental materials. Developed using profiles from all oceans, the algorithm is compared to threshold methods that use the C. de Boyer Montégut et al. criteria and to gradient methods using 13 601 Argo profiles from the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic Oceans. In general, the threshold methods find deeper MLDs than the new algorithm and the gradient methods produce more anomalous MLDs than the new algorithm. When constrained to using only temperature profiles, the algorithm offers a clear improvement over the temperature threshold and gradient methods; the new temperature algorithm MLDs more closely approximate the density algorithm MLDs than the temperature threshold and gradient MLDs. The algorithm is applied to profiles from a formation region of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). The density algorithm finds that the deepest MLDs in this region routinely reach 500 dbar and occur north of the A. H. Orsi et al. mean Subantarctic Front in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The deepest MLDs typically occur in August and September and are congruent with the subsurface salinity minimum, a signature of AAIW.},

The individual profile results in the database can be used to construct time series of mixed layer properties in specific regions of interest. The climatology and database are available online at http://mixedlayer.ucsd.edu. The MLDs calculated by the hybrid algorithm are shallower and generally more accurate than those of the threshold method, particularly in regions of deep winter mixed layers; the new climatology differs the most from existing mixed layer climatologies in these regions. Examples are presented from the Labrador and Irminger Seas, the Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic Ocean near the Gulf Stream.

Using nearly 350,000 temperature and salinity profiles, we constructed an upper-ocean climatology and monthly anomaly fields for the 5-year era, 2004–2008. A basic description of the modern upper ocean based entirely on Argo data is presented here, to provide a baseline for comparison with past datasets and with ongoing Argo data, to test the adequacy of Argo sampling of large-scale variability, and to examine the consistency of the Argo dataset with related ocean observations from other programs. The Argo 5-year mean is compared to the World Ocean Atlas, highlighting the middle and high latitudes of the southern hemisphere as a region of strong multi-decadal warming and freshening. Moreover the region is one where Argo data have contributed an enormous increment to historical sampling, and where more Argo floats are needed for documenting large-scale variability. Globally, the Argo-era ocean is warmer than the historical climatology at nearly all depths, by an increasing amount toward the sea surface; it is saltier in the surface layer and fresher at intermediate levels. Annual cycles in temperature and salinity are compared, again to WOA01, and to the National Oceanography Center air–sea flux climatology, the Reynolds SST product, and AVISO satellite altimetric height. These products are consistent with Argo data on hemispheric and global scales, but show regional differences that may either point to systematic errors in the datasets or their syntheses, to physical processes, or to temporal variability. The present work is viewed as an initial step toward integrating Argo and other climate-relevant global ocean datasets.},

	abstract = {Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is an essential climate variable that requires long term in situ observation. The French SSS Observation Service (SSS-OS) manages a network of Voluntary Observing Ships equipped with thermosalinographs (TSG). The network is global though more concentrated in the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic oceanic basins. The acquisition system is autonomous with real time transmission and is regularly serviced at harbor calls. There are distinct real time and delayed time processing chains. Real time processing includes automatic alerts to detect potential instrument problems, in case raw data are outside of climatic limits, and graphical monitoring tools. Delayed time processing relies on a dedicated software for attribution of data quality flags by visual inspection, and correction of TSG time series by comparison with daily water samples and collocated Argo data. A method for optimizing the automatic attribution of quality flags in real time, based on testing different thresholds for data deviation from climatology and retroactively comparing the resulting flags to delayed time flags, is presented. The SSS-OS real time data feed the Coriolis operational oceanography database, while the research-quality delayed time data can be extracted for selected time and geographical ranges through a graphical web interface. Delayed time data have been also combined with other SSS data sources to produce gridded files for the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. A short review of the research activities conducted with such data is given. It includes observation-based process-oriented and climate studies from regional to global scale as well as studies where in situ SSS is used for calibration/validation of models, coral proxies or satellite data.},

The upper 350 m of a 1000 km long section in the subtropical North Pacific was observed in winter, spring, and summer with 3–14 km horizontal resolution. Four vertical regions had distinct density and salinity structure: the mixed layer, remnant mixed layer, high-stratification layer, and permanent thermocline. The remnant mixed layer consists of water from the winter mixed layer left over after restratification. The remnant mixed layer was most similar to the mixed layer in winter and spring, and most similar to the high-stratification layer below in summer. The high-stratification layer had elevated stratification that varied seasonally. The permanent thermocline varied little seasonally and was horizontally and vertically uniform in comparison. In all seasons, density ratios showed that mixed-layer θ-S differences tended to compensate in density with the strongest tendency toward compensation in winter. Density ratios were temperature dominated in the remnant mixed layer consistent with salt-fingering. Salinity anomalies were largest at the surface and decayed with depth in all seasons. Spectra of isopycnal depth and θ-S anomalies along isopycnals are compared between the three seasons and four vertical layers. Isopycnal depth variance at 30–46 km wavelengths decreased from winter to spring to summer by a factor of 2–10 in stratified regions. By treating salinity anomalies as a tracer, the effective isopycnal diffusivity in the remnant mixed layer was estimated to be 1.4 m2 s−1 over 30–46 km wavelengths.},

Temperature and salinity fields are permanently forced at large scales and are related to density by a linear equation of state. We show, using some inherent properties of quasi-geostrophic turbulence, that the 3-D ageostrophic circulation is the key dynamical characteristic that governs the strength and the spatial distribution of small-scale thermohaline fronts that are strongly density compensated. The numerical simulations well illustrate the formation by the mesoscale eddy field of sharp thermohaline fronts that are mainly located in the saddle regions and around the eddy cores and have a weak signature on the density field. One important aspect revealed by the numerical results is that the thermohaline anomalies experience not only a direct horizontal cascade but also a significant vertical cascade. One consequence of this 3-D cascade is that the ultimate mixing of the thermohaline anomalies will not be necessarily maximum at the depth where the large-scale temperature and salinity anomalies are maximum. Some analytical arguments allow us to identify some of the mechanisms that drive this 3-D cascade.},

More than two years of underwater glider observations in the central subtropical North Pacific showed thermohaline variability over horizontal scales from 5 to 1300 km. Thermohaline fluctuations along isopycnals (spice fluctuations) were elevated in layers throughout the water column with the largest fluctuations near the surface and subtropical frontal regions. Fluctuations were uncorrelated between the layers but stirred by the same velocity field. Spice variance had local extrema in the vertical because of differences in source water properties and the influence of neighboring water masses. Spice variance spanned about three orders of magnitude along deeper isopycnals with larger variance where different water masses met and where velocity and vorticity variance were elevated. Horizontal wave number spectra of spice had slopes of −2 everywhere in the upper 1000 m. Submesoscale spice fluctuations had slopes in physical space near the ratio of the Coriolis parameter to the buoyancy frequency (f/N), consistent with predictions of quasi-geostrophic theory. In the mixed layer, thermohaline structure had a significant annual cycle with smaller interannual differences. Thermohaline fluctuations left behind during restratification and isolated from the mixed layer decayed with time because of diffusion along isopycnals. Horizontal diffusivity estimates in the remnant mixed layer were 0.4 m2 s−1 at 15–28 km wavelengths and 0.9 m2 s−1 at 35–45 km wavelengths.},

With the exception of the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, the seasonal KE fluctuations of the surface balanced and unbalanced motions are out of phase because of the occurrence of mixed layer instability in winter and trapping of unbalanced motion KE in shallow mixed layer in summer. The combined effect of these seasonal changes renders Lt to be 20 km during winter in 80\% of the Northern Hemisphere oceans between 25° and 45°N and all of the Southern Hemisphere oceans south of 25°S. The transition scale’s geographical and seasonal changes are highly relevant to the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. To improve the detection of balanced submesoscale signals from SWOT, especially in the tropical oceans, efforts to remove stationary internal tidal signals are called for.},

	abstract = {A common dynamical paradigm is that turbulence in the upper ocean is dominated by three classes of motion: mesoscale geostrophic eddies, internal waves and microscale three?dimensional turbulence. Close to the ocean surface, however, a fourth class of turbulent motion is important: submesoscale frontal dynamics. These have a horizontal scale of O(1?10) km, a vertical scale of O(100) m, and a time scale of O(1) day. Here we review the physical?chemical?biological dynamics of submesoscale features, and discuss strategies for sampling them. Submesoscale fronts arise dynamically through nonlinear instabilities of the mesoscale currents. They are ephemeral, lasting only a few days after they are formed. Strong submesoscale vertical velocities can drive episodic nutrient pulses to the euphotic zone, and subduct organic carbon into the ocean's interior. The reduction of vertical mixing at submesoscale fronts can locally increase the mean time that photosynthetic organisms spend in the well?lit euphotic layer and promote primary production. Horizontal stirring can create intense patchiness in planktonic species. Submesoscale dynamics therefore can change not only primary and export production, but also the structure and the functioning of the planktonic ecosystem. Because of their short time and space scales, sampling of submesoscale features requires new technologies and approaches. This paper presents a critical overview of current knowledge to focus attention and hopefully interest on the pressing scientific questions concerning these dynamics.},

The lateral gradients are shown to be unstable to ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and slump from the horizontal to the vertical. These instabilities, which are referred to as mixed layer instabilities (MLIs), differ from instabilities in the ocean interior because of the weak surface stratification. Spatial scales are O(1–10) km, and growth time scales are on the order of a day. Linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear simulations are used to study MLIs and their impact on mixed layer restratification. The main result is that MLIs are a leading-order process in the ML heat budget acting to constantly restratify the surface ocean. Climate and regional ocean models do not resolve the scales associated with MLIs and are likely to underestimate the rate of ML restratification and consequently suffer from a bias in sea surface temperatures and ML depths. In a forthcoming paper, the authors discuss a parameterization scheme to include the effect of MLIs in ocean models.},

Submesoscale processes are particularly relevant to phytoplankton productivity because the timescales on which they act are similar to those of phytoplankton growth. Their dynamics are associated with strong vorticity and strain rates that occur on lateral scales of 0.1-10 km. They can support vertical velocities as large as 100 m d(-1) and play a crucial role in transporting nutrients into the sunlit ocean for phytoplankton production. In regimes with deep surface mixed layers, submesoscale instabilities can cause stratification within days, thereby increasing light exposure for phytoplankton trapped close to the surface. These instabilities help to create and maintain localized environments that favor the growth of phytoplankton, contribute to productivity, and cause enormous heterogeneity in the abundance of phytoplankton, which has implications for interactions within the ecosystem.},

At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k−3 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia–gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic flows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.},

It follows that the spectral steepness of real flows in the enstrophy inertial range must be extremely difficult to estimate from correlation or dispersion measurements alone. This might explain why the existence of steep spectra, speculated on the basis of numerical modeling, has not been confirmed by real flow measurements.},

The method requires certain assumptions for the data regarding stationarity, homogeneity, and horizontal isotropy. In the first step an exact Helmholtz decomposition of the horizontal velocity spectra into rotational and divergent components is performed and in the second step an energy equipartition property of hydrostatic inertia–gravity waves is exploited that allows a diagnosis of the wave energy spectrum solely from the observed horizontal velocities. The observed buoyancy spectrum can then be used to compute the residual vortex energy spectrum. Further wave–vortex decompositions of the observed fields are possible if additional information about the frequency content of the waves is available. We illustrate the method on two recent oceanic data sets from the North Pacific and the Gulf Stream.

Less attention has been devoted to studying submesoscale flows in the open ocean, far from long-term, mean geostrophic fronts, characteristic of a large proportion of the global ocean. This study presents a year-long, submesoscale-resolving time series of near-surface buoyancy gradients, potential vorticity, and instability characteristics, collected by ocean gliders, that provides insight into open-ocean submesoscale dynamics over a full annual cycle. The gliders continuously sampled a 225 km2 region in the subtropical northeast Atlantic, measuring temperature, salinity, and pressure along 292 short ({\textasciitilde}20 km) hydrographic sections. Glider observations show a seasonal cycle in near-surface stratification. Throughout the fall (September–November), the mixed layer deepens, predominantly through gravitational instability, indicating that surface cooling dominates submesoscale restratification processes. During winter (December–March), mixed layer depths are more variable, and estimates of the balanced Richardson number, which measures the relative importance of lateral and vertical buoyancy gradients, depict conditions favorable to symmetric instability. The importance of mixed layer instabilities on the restratification of the mixed layer, as compared with surface heating and cooling, shows that submesoscale processes can reverse the sign of an equivalent heat flux up to 25\% of the time during winter. These results demonstrate that the open-ocean mixed layer hosts various forced and unforced instabilities, which become more prevalent during winter, and emphasize that accurate parameterizations of submesoscale processes are needed throughout the ocean.},

	abstract = {Decade-long satellite altimeter data from the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon and European Remote Sensing Satellite-1 and-2 (ERS-1/2) missions are analyzed to investigate the eddy signals in the South Pacific Ocean. High–eddy kinetic energy (EKE) bands with well-defined annual cycles are detected along the eastward-flowing surface currents of the South Tropical Countercurrent (STCC) between 21°–29°S and the South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) centered near 9°S. Overriding the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC), the STCC layer has the sign of its mean potential vorticity gradient opposite to that in the SEC layer, subjecting the vertically sheared STCC–SEC system to baroclinic instability. In austral winter, the STCC–SEC system is baroclinically more unstable than in other seasons because of the large vertical shear and weak stratification. This seasonal variation in the intensity of baroclinic instability is responsible for the seasonal modulation of the STCC's EKE field with a November–December maximum and a June–July minimum. The large deformation radius in the low-latitude SECC region, on the other hand, prevents the vertically sheared SECC–SEC system from becoming baroclinically unstable. With the broad, westward-flowing SEC weakening the stabilizing planetary β effect, the high EKE level observed along the SECC is found to result from the barotropic instability associated with the horizontal shear of the SECC–SEC system. Together with an analysis of energetics, it is shown that the seasonal variation in the intensity of barotropic instability accounts for the seasonal modulation of the SECC's EKE field, with a maximum in April and a minimum in August.},

Conventional harmonic analysis is first applied to estimate and remove the stationary components of the tide at each point along the reference ground tracks. The wavenumber spectrum of the residual SSH is then computed, and the variance in a neighborhood around the wavenumber of the mode-1 baroclinic M2 tide is interpreted as the sum of noise, broadband nontidal processes, and the nonstationary tide. At many sites a bump in the spectrum associated with the internal tide is noted, and an empirical model for the noise and nontidal processes is used to estimate the nonstationary semidiurnal tidal variance. The results indicate a spatially inhomogeneous pattern of tidal variability. Nonstationary tides are larger than stationary tides throughout much of the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans.},

Plane wave analysis is employed to extract three mode-1 S2 internal tidal waves in any given 250 km by 250 km window, which are temporally coherent over a 20 year period from 1992 to 2012. Depth-integrated energy and flux of the S2 internal tide are calculated from the SSH amplitude and a conversion function built from climatological hydrographic profiles in the World Ocean Atlas 2013. The results show that the S2 and M2 internal tides have similar spatial patterns. Both S2 and M2 internal tides originate at major topographic features and propagate over long distances. The S2 internal tidal beams are generally shorter, likely because the relatively weaker S2 internal tide is easily overwhelmed by nontidal noise. The northbound S2 and M2 internal tides from the Hawaiian Ridge are observed to travel over 3500 km across the Northeast Pacific. The globally integrated energy of the mode-1 S2 internal tide is 7.8 PJ (1 PJ = 1015 J), about 20\% that of M2 (36.4 PJ). The histogram of S2 to M2 SSH ratios peaks at 0.4, consistent with the square root of their energy ratio. In terms of SSH, S2 is greater than M2 in 10\% of the global ocean and ≥50\% of M2 in about half of the global ocean.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence and temperature were measured with a horizontal resolution of 4m on two isopycnals and two isobars along a 1000km meridional transect in the eastern North Pacific. Probability density functions (PDFs) of the magnitude of fluctuations in temperature and fluorescence are compared at each of a large range of length scales. While they are nearly identical at larger scales, the shapes of the PDFs of fluorescence and temperature differ significantly at small scales (∼1km and less). This difference may indicate that at these scales, temperature and fluorescence distributions are controlled by distinct mechanisms. By comparing the phase of wavelet transforms of each of these two tracers, the tendency for temperature and fluorescence gradients to line up is investigated over a large range of spatial scales. At horizontal length scales of order 10km and larger, the wavelet phase difference between temperature and fluorescence tends to be close to 0° or 180°—that is, the gradients tend to align, either in phase or 180° out of phase. At smaller scales, the distribution of phase difference on isopycnals is uniform—there is no tendency for gradients to coincide. Simple stirring models demonstrate that the locations of enhanced gradients in all tracers would be expected to coincide where the strain has been greatest. However, the directions of enhanced gradients formed in this way may be either parallel or antiparallel, depending on initial conditions and on the direction of the strain. These analyses suggest the horizontal distributions of temperature and fluorescence at large scales were both governed by advective processes. At intermediate scales, of order 1–10km, a renovating wave model suggests that gradient alignment could be destroyed by turbulent diffusion or by rapid local phytoplankton growth.},

Non-Boussinesq, non-uniform potential vorticity, latent heat, and surface friction effects are all studied. Using a two-region fluid we model the effects of confluence near the tropopause. A similar approach is made to the appearance of fronts in the finite-amplitude development of the simplest Eady wave; this is also solved analytically.

This simulation resolves smaller scales (down to ≈10 km) than altimetric data (limited to 70 km because of the noise level). In high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) regions (as in the western part), SSH spectral slope almost follows a k−4 (with k the wavenumber) or slightly steeper law in agreement with altimeter studies. The new result is that, unlike altimeter studies, such a k−4 slope is also observed in low EKE regions (as in the eastern part). In these regions, this slope mostly concerns scales not well resolved by altimetric data. Such k−4 SSH spectral slopes are weaker from what is expected from quasigeostrophic turbulence theory but closer to surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory. The consequence is that the small scales concerned by these spectral slopes, in particular in low EKE regions, may significantly affect the larger ones because of the inverse kinetic energy cascade. These results need to be confirmed using a longer numerical integration. They also need to be corroborated by high-resolution observations.},

The spectral shape in the wavelength range of 70–250 km was approximated by a power law, representing a regime governed by geostrophic turbulence theories. The effects of altimeter instrument noise were assumed insignificant at wavelengths longer than 70 km. The authors reexamined the assumption in the study. Using nearly simultaneous observations made by Jason-1 and Jason-2 during their cross-calibration phase, this study found that the white noise level of altimetry measurement was best estimated from the spectral values at wavelengths from 25 to 35 km. After removing a white noise level based on such estimate from the SSH spectrum, the spectral slope values changed significantly over most of the oceans. A key finding is that the spectral slopes are generally steeper than k−2 (k is wavenumber) poleward of the 20° latitudes, where flatter spectral slopes in some regions have previously caused problems for dynamic interpretations. The new results indicate that the spectral slopes in the core regions of the major ocean current systems have values between the original geostrophic turbulence theory and the surface quasigeostrophic theory. The near k−4 spectrum suggests that the sea surface height variability at these wavelengths in the high eddy energy regions might be governed by frontogenesis.},

	abstract = {Recently, it has been discussed whether the mesoscale energy spectra in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are generated by weakly or strongly nonlinear dynamics. A necessary condition for weak nonlinearity is that the Rossby number Ro ≡ {\textbar}ζz{\textbar}/f ≪ 1, where ζz is the vertical vorticity and f is the Coriolis parameter. First, it is shown that Ro can be estimated by integration of the rotational wavenumber energy spectrum Er. Then divergence and rotational energy spectra and their ratio, R ≡ Ed/Er, are calculated from the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) dataset, and it is shown that at least 1000 flight segments are needed to obtain converged results. It is found that R {\textless} 1 in the upper troposphere, ruling out the hypothesis that the spectra are produced by inertia–gravity waves with frequencies larger than f. In the lower stratosphere R is slightly larger than unity. An analysis separating between land and ocean data shows that Ed and temperature spectra have somewhat larger magnitude over land compared to ocean in the upper troposphere—a signature of orographically or convectively forced gravity waves.

At midlatitudes the Rossby number is on the order of unity and at low latitudes it is larger than unity, indicating that strong nonlinearities are prevalent. Also the temperature spectra, when converted into potential energy spectra, have larger magnitude than predicted by the weakly nonlinear wave hypothesis.},

The mission objectives are primarily the observation of the oceanic mesoscales but also include coastal oceanography, global and regional sea level monitoring, data assimilation, and operational oceanography. The mission ended its nominal phase after 3 years in orbit and began a new phase (drifting orbit) in July 2016. The objective of this paper is to provide a state of the art of the achievements of the SARAL/AltiKa mission in terms of quality assessment and unique characteristics of AltiKa data. It shows that the AltiKa data have similar accuracy at the centimeter level in term of absolute water level whatever the method (from local to global) and the type of water surfaces (ocean and lakes). It shows also that beyond the fact that AltiKa data quality meets the expectations and initial mission requirements, the unique characteristics of the altimeter and the Ka-band offer unique contributions in fields that were previously not fully foreseen.},

	abstract = {We perform numerical box simulations of strongly stratified turbulence. The equations solved are the Boussinesq equations with constant Brunt–Väisälä frequency and forcing either in rotational or divergent modes, or, with another terminology, in vortical or wave modes. In both cases, we observe a forward energy cascade and inertial-range scaling of the horizontal kinetic and potential energy spectra. With forcing in rotational modes, there is approximate equipartition of kinetic energy between rotational and divergent modes in the inertial range. With forcing in divergent modes the results are sensitive to the vertical forcing wavenumber kfv. If kfv is sufficiently large the dynamics is very similar to the dynamics of the simulations which are forced in rotational modes, with approximate equipartition of kinetic energy in rotational and divergent modes in the inertial range. Frequency spectra of rotational, divergent and potential energy are calculated for individual Fourier modes. Waves are present at low horizontal wavenumbers corresponding to the largest scales in the boxes. In the inertial range, the frequency spectra exhibit no distinctive peaks in the internal wave frequency. In modes for which the vertical wavenumber is considerably larger than the horizontal wavenumber, the frequency spectra of rotational and divergent modes fall on top of each other. The simulation results indicate that the dynamics of rotational and divergent modes develop on the same time scale in stratified turbulence. We discuss the relevance of our results to atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. In particular, we review a number of observational reports indicating that stratified turbulence may be a prevalent dynamic process in the ocean at horizontal scales of the order of 10 or 100 m up to several kilometres.},

	abstract = {As observations and models improve their resolution of oceanic motions at ever finer horizontal scales, interest has grown in characterizing the transition from the geostrophically balanced flows that dominate at large-scale to submesoscale turbulence and waves that dominate at small scales. In this study we examine the mesoscale-to-submesoscale (100 to 10 km) transition in an eastern boundary current, the southern California Current System (CCS), using repeated acoustic Doppler current profiler transects, sea surface height from high-resolution nadir altimetry and output from a (1/48)° global model simulation. In the CCS, the submesoscale is as energetic as in western boundary current regions, but the mesoscale is much weaker, and as a result the transition lacks the change in kinetic energy (KE) spectral slope observed for western boundary currents. Helmholtz and vortex-wave decompositions of the KE spectra are used to identify balanced and unbalanced contributions. At horizontal scales greater than 70 km, we find that observed KE is dominated by balanced geostrophic motions. At scales from 40 to 10 km, unbalanced contributions such as inertia-gravity waves contribute as much as balanced motions. The model KE transition occurs at longer scales, around 125 km. The altimeter spectra are consistent with acoustic Doppler current profiler/model spectra at scales longer than 70/125 km, respectively. Observed seasonality is weak. Taken together, our results suggest that geostrophic velocities can be diagnosed from sea surface height on scales larger than about 70 km in the southern CCS.},

While the mean pathways are known, the contribution to the mixing and transport of the water from mesoscale eddies has not been comprehensively investigated. In this research, satellite altimetry data, combined with an eddy detection and tracking algorithm is used to investigate the distribution and surface characteristics of mesoscale eddies in this region of complex bathymetry (10°S?30°S, 140°E?190°E). Detected eddies are then colocalized with in situ data from Argo floats to determine their vertical structure and the effect of eddies on the water masses. The numerous islands affect the eddy behavior as most eddies are formed in the lee of islands, propagate westward and decay when encountering shallow bathymetry. Eddies are sparse and short-lived in the tropical area north of Fiji, impacting only the top 200 meters of water. They do not appear to be able to trap and transport waters in this region. In the Coral Sea, a region of lateral shear between currents transporting waters of different origins, eddies are more numerous and energetic. They affect the water properties down to at least 500 m depth, and anticyclonic eddies trap water to ?200 m, contributing to the upper thermocline waters mixing and transport. South of New Caledonia, mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous, with typical lifetimes longer than 5 months. They affect the temperature, salinity, and velocities down to ?1,000 m depth, and weakly contribute to the mixing of lower thermocline waters.},

This north–south difference cannot be explained by alongshore variability of the projected wind stress and no strong evidence for alternative explanations has been proposed. A major objective of this paper is to provide the first dynamical analysis of New Caledonia upwelling and its regional environment, based on numerical simulations. Coastal upwelling around New Caledonia is shown to be modulated by a system of geostrophic currents interacting with the island mass. Upwelling velocities are weaker than expected from the two-dimensional Ekman theory, as Ekman divergence is balanced by “coastal geostrophic convergence”. The cooling effect of upwelling is also attenuated by alongshore transport of warm water by the Alis current, reminiscent of the Leeuwin current off Western Australia. Nevertheless, coastal upwelling can locally modify the large-scale surface water heat budget, dominated by meridional advection warming and surface cooling. The upwelled waters appear to be mostly of western origin and are transported below the surface by the Subtropical Counter Current before upwelling off New Caledonia. This appears in sharp contrast with the eastern barrier reef where the general warming by meridional advection of tropical surface waters is accentuated by the vigorous western boundary type Vauban current.},

The BBLs generate vertical vorticity ζ and potential vorticity q on slopes; the flow separates and spawns shear layers; barotropic and centrifugal shear instabilities form submesoscale vortical filaments and induce a high rate of local energy dissipation; the filaments organize into vortices that then horizontally merge and vertically align to form SCVs. These SCVs have O(1) Rossby numbers () and horizontal and vertical scales that are much larger than those of the separated shear layers and associated vortical filaments. Although the upstream flow is barotropic, downstream baroclinicity manifests in the wake, depending on the value of the nondimensional height , which is the ratio of the seamount height  to that of the Taylor height , where L is the seamount half-width. When , SCVs span the vertical extent of the seamount itself.

In the Coral Sea a strong seasonal cycle in the surface heat flux leads to a winter SM “soup” consisting of baroclinic mixed layer eddies (MLEs), fronts, and filaments similar to those seen in other regions farther away from the equator. However, a strong wind stress seasonal cycle, largely in sync with the surface heat flux cycle, is also a source of SM processes. SM restratification fluxes show distinctive signatures corresponding to both surface cooling and wind stress. The winter peak in SM activity in the Coral Sea is not in phase with the summer dominance of the mesoscale eddy kinetic energy in the region, implying that local surface layer forcing effects are more important for SM generation than the nonlocal eddy deformation field. In the topographically complex Solomon and Bismarck Seas, a combination of equatorial proximity and boundary drag generates SCVs with large-vorticity Rossby numbers (Ro {\textasciitilde} 10). River outflows in the Bismarck and Solomon Seas make a contribution to SM generation, although they are considerably weaker than the topographic effects. Mean to eddy kinetic energy conversions implicate barotropic instability in SM topographic wakes, with the strongest values seen north of the Vitiaz Strait along the coast of Papua New Guinea.},

This surface amplification is well captured by linear theory, provided that the stratification at the base of the mixed layer is accurately represented.

Submesoscale flows are energized by baroclinic instabilities that develop around geostrophic eddies in the deep winter mixed layer at a horizontal scale of order 1–10 km.

	abstract = {Internal tides power much of the observed small-scale turbulence in the ocean interior. To represent mixing induced by this turbulence in ocean climate models, the cascade of internal tide energy to dissipation scales must be understood and mapped. Here, we present a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks. The mapping relies on the following ingredients: (i) a global observational climatology of stratification; (ii) maps of the generation of M2, S2 and K1 internal tides decomposed into vertical normal modes; (iii) simplified representations of the dissipation of low-mode internal tides due to wave-wave interactions, scattering by small-scale topography, interaction with critical slopes and shoaling; (iv) Lagrangian tracking of low-mode energy beams through observed stratification, including refraction and reflection. We thus obtain a global map of the column-integrated energy dissipation for each of the four considered dissipative processes, each of the three tidal constituents and each of the first five modes. Modes ≥6 are inferred to dissipate within the local water column at the employed half-degree horizontal resolution. Combining all processes, modes and constituents, we construct a map of the total internal tide energy dissipation, which compares well with observational inferences of internal wave energy dissipation. This result suggests that tides largely shape observed spatial contrasts of dissipation, and that the framework has potential in improving understanding and modelling of ocean mixing. However, sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters and simplifying assumptions entering the parameterized energy sinks calls for additional investigation. The attenuation of low-mode internal tides by wave-wave interactions needs particular attention.},

	abstract = {Abstract The mode-2 M2 internal tide is observed from satellite altimetry. It is extracted in two steps: First, the mode-2 component is separated from modes 1 and 3 by a bandpass filter with cutoff wavelengths of [0.85 1.35]??2, where ?2 is the mode-2 wavelength; and second, three mode-2 internal tidal waves are extracted by fitting plane waves in each 120 km by 120 km window. The satellite-observed mode-2 M2 internal tide underestimates its strength: It contains the phase-locked component only, missing the time-varying component; it contains the southbound/northbound component only, missing the eastbound/westbound component. The satellite results provide rich information on the global mode-2 M2 internal tide. The results show that the mode-2 M2 internal tide is ubiquitous in the ocean, and its sea surface height amplitudes are O (1 mm). The spatial patterns of mode-1 and mode-2 internal tides are very different. Mode 1 mainly originates at steep topographic features such as submarine ridges, but mode 2 is also generated at gentler topographic features such as abyssal seamounts and fracture zones. Mode-1 beams propagate O (1,000 km), while mode-2 beams can be tracked for O (100 km). Depth-integrated energy and flux are calculated using sea surface height amplitudes and conversion functions built from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. The globally integrated energy of the mode-2 M2 internal tide approximates to 8 PJ, about 22\% of mode 1 (36.4 PJ). This work suggests that higher-mode internal tides play an important role in the tidal energetics, in particular, over abyssal seamounts and fracture zones.},

In the equatorial band the El Niño (La Niña) events are chiefly concerned (1) in the east and center, with warmer (colder) than average SST and a η increase (decrease), and (2) in the west, with fresher (saltier) than average SSS, westerly (easterly) wind anomalies, above (below) average P limited to the east of about 150°E, and a η decrease (increase); Much smaller ENSO changes occur away from the equatorial band except in the convergence zones for SSS, P, arid τy changes and in two patches centered around 7°N and 7°S in the west for curl (τ). The ENSO-related η changes are schematically concerned with a zonal “seesaw” in phase with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in the equatorial band and a meridional seesaw between the regions situated north and south of about 5°N, which lags by about 1 year behind the SOI. The double seesaws result in a longitudinal mean η rise (drop) within about 5°N–20°S up to the mature phase of El Niño (La Niña), and not just until its beginning, partly compensated by a longitudinal mean η drop (rise) within about 5°–20°N. Aside from its intrinsic substance, this paper offers a novel and concise observational basis for testing theoretical studies and model simulations.},

	abstract = {When some external agency imposes on a fluid large-scale variations of some dynamically passive, conserved, scalar quantity θ like temperature or concentration of solute, turbulent motion of the fluid generates small-scale variations of θ. This paper describes a theoretical investigation of the form of the spectrum of θ at large wave-numbers, taking into account the two effects of convection with the fluid and molecular diffusion with diffusivity k. Hypotheses of the kind made by Kolmogoroff for the small-scale variations of velocity in a turbulent motion at high Reynolds number are assumed to apply also to small-scale variations of θ.Previous contributions to the problem are reviewed. These have established that the spectrum of θ varies as n−53 n{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{5\} \{3\}\} (n being wave-number) at the low wave-number end of the equilibrium range, but there has been some confusion about the wave-number marking the upper end of the range of validity of this relation. The existence of a conduction ‘cut-off’ near n={\textbackslash}isin{\textbackslash}solk3)14 n = {\textbackslash}isin\{{\textbackslash}sol\}k \{{\textasciicircum}3\}) \{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} as put forward by Obukhoff and Corrsin is shown to hold only when ν [Lt ] κ, and that near n = (ε/νκ2) 14 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} put forward by Batchelor is shown to apply only when ν [Gt ] κ. In the case ν [Lt ] κ, the remaining problem is to determine the form of the spectrum of θ beyond the conduction cut-off; this is done in Part 2. In the case ν [Gt ] κ, the conduction cut-off occurs at wave-numbers much higher than (ε/ν3)14 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\}, which is where the energy spectrum is cut off by viscosity, and where the spectrum of θ ceases to vary as n−53 n{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{5\} \{3\}\}.The form of the spectrum of θ in this latter case is determined over the range n {\textgreater} (ε/ν3)14 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} by analysing the effect of the velocity field, regarded as effectively a persistent uniform straining motion for these small-scale variations of θ, and of molecular diffusion on a single Fourier component of θ. The wave-number of this sinusoidal variation of θ is changed (and generally increased in magnitude) by the straining motion and the amplitude is diminished by diffusion. By supposing that the level of the spectrum of θ is kept steady at wave-numbers near (ε/ν3)14 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} by some mechanism of transfer from lower wave-numbers, the linearity of the equation for θ then allows the determination of the spectrum for n {\textgreater} (ε/ν3) 14 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\}, the result being given by (4.8). The same result is obtained, using essentially the same approximation about the velocity field, from a different kind of analysis in terms of velocity and θ correlations. Finally, the relation between this work and Townsend's model of the small-scale variations of vorticity in a turbulent fluid is discussed.},

	abstract = {Lateral stirring is a basic oceanographic phenomenon affecting the distribution of physical, chemical, and biological fields. Eddy stirring at scales on the order of 100 km (the mesoscale) is fairly well understood and explicitly represented in modern eddy-resolving numerical models of global ocean circulation. The same cannot be said for smaller-scale stirring processes. Here, the authors describe a major oceanographic field experiment aimed at observing and understanding the processes responsible for stirring at scales of 0.1–10 km. Stirring processes of varying intensity were studied in the Sargasso Sea eddy field approximately 250 km southeast of Cape Hatteras. Lateral variability of water-mass properties, the distribution of microscale turbulence, and the evolution of several patches of inert dye were studied with an array of shipboard, autonomous, and airborne instruments. Observations were made at two sites, characterized by weak and moderate background mesoscale straining, to contrast different regimes of lateral stirring. Analyses to date suggest that, in both cases, the lateral dispersion of natural and deliberately released tracers was O(1) m2 s–1 as found elsewhere, which is faster than might be expected from traditional shear dispersion by persistent mesoscale flow and linear internal waves. These findings point to the possible importance of kilometer-scale stirring by submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal-wave processes or the need to modify the traditional shear-dispersion paradigm to include higher-order effects. A unique aspect of the Scalable Lateral Mixing and Coherent Turbulence (LatMix) field experiment is the combination of direct measurements of dye dispersion with the concurrent multiscale hydrographic and turbulence observations, enabling evaluation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed dispersion at a new level.},
